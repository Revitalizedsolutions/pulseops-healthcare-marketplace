# HIPAA Compliance Requirements for PulseOps

## Current Status: ⚠️ NOT FULLY COMPLIANT

While the application includes HIPAA-aware messaging and security notices, it does not yet meet the technical, administrative, and physical safeguards required by HIPAA.

## Required HIPAA Safeguards

### 1. Administrative Safeguards
- [ ] **Security Officer**: Designated HIPAA Security Officer
- [ ] **Workforce Training**: All staff trained on HIPAA requirements
- [ ] **Access Management**: Formal access control procedures
- [ ] **Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)**: Signed with all vendors
- [ ] **Incident Response**: Documented breach notification procedures
- [ ] **Risk Assessment**: Annual security risk assessments

### 2. Physical Safeguards
- [ ] **Facility Access**: Controlled access to servers/workstations
- [ ] **Workstation Security**: Secure workstation configurations
- [ ] **Device Controls**: Hardware/software inventory and controls
- [ ] **Media Disposal**: Secure disposal of storage media

### 3. Technical Safeguards

#### ❌ Currently Missing:
- **Encryption at Rest**: Database encryption (Supabase provides this)
- **Encryption in Transit**: All communications must use TLS 1.2+ (Supabase provides this)
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access with minimum necessary principle
- **Audit Logs**: Comprehensive logging of all PHI access
- **User Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication required
- **Session Management**: Automatic logouts, session timeouts
- **Data Backup**: Encrypted backups with tested recovery procedures

#### ✅ Partially Implemented:
- Basic user authentication
- Row Level Security (RLS) in database
- Some access controls

## What Needs to Be Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Authentication & Authorization
```typescript
// Multi-factor authentication
interface MFAConfig {
  enabled: boolean;
  methods: ('sms' | 'email' | 'authenticator')[];
  required: boolean;
}

// Session management
interface SessionConfig {
  timeout: number; // minutes
  maxConcurrent: number;
  requireReauth: boolean;
}
```

### 2. Comprehensive Audit Logging
```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  action text NOT NULL, -- 'view', 'create', 'update', 'delete', 'download'
  resource_type text NOT NULL, -- 'document', 'profile', 'message'
  resource_id text NOT NULL,
  phi_accessed boolean DEFAULT false,
  ip_address inet,
  user_agent text,
  timestamp timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  details jsonb
);
```

### 3. Data Encryption
```typescript
// Client-side encryption for sensitive data
import { encrypt, decrypt } from './encryption';

const encryptSensitiveData = (data: string): string => {
  return encrypt(data, process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY);
};

// Database field encryption
const encryptedSSN = encryptSensitiveData(nurseData.ssn);
```

### 4. Access Controls
```sql
-- Minimum necessary access principle
CREATE POLICY "Minimum necessary PHI access"
  ON nurse_profiles
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    -- Only allow access to specific fields based on user role and relationship
    CASE 
      WHEN auth.uid() = user_id THEN true -- Own data
      WHEN EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM job_assignments 
        WHERE nurse_id = nurse_profiles.user_id 
        AND hco_id = auth.uid() 
        AND status = 'active'
      ) THEN true -- Active job relationship
      ELSE false
    END
  );
```

### 5. Document Security
```typescript
// Secure document handling
interface SecureDocument {
  id: string;
  encryptedContent: string; // Encrypted file content
  accessLog: DocumentAccess[];
  expirationDate?: Date;
  watermark: string; // User-specific watermark
}

interface DocumentAccess {
  userId: string;
  accessedAt: Date;
  ipAddress: string;
  action: 'view' | 'download' | 'share';
}
```

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Supabase Configuration for HIPAA
```yaml
# Required Supabase settings
database:
  encryption_at_rest: true
  ssl_enforcement: true
  backup_encryption: true
  
auth:
  mfa_required: true
  session_timeout: 30 # minutes
  password_policy:
    min_length: 12
    require_special_chars: true
    
storage:
  encryption: true
  access_logging: true
  virus_scanning: true
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for HIPAA compliance
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-256-bit-encryption-key
AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=2555 # 7 years minimum
MFA_REQUIRED=true
SESSION_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=30
BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-backup-encryption-key
```

## Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)

### Required BAAs:
- ✅ **Supabase**: Has HIPAA BAA available
- ❌ **Stripe**: Need to verify HIPAA compliance for payment processing
- ❌ **Any email service**: For notifications
- ❌ **Any analytics service**: Google Analytics, etc.
- ❌ **Any monitoring service**: Error tracking, performance monitoring
